    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lobio, meaning “beans” in Georgian, is a comforting, earthy stew made from red kidney beans slow-cooked with onions, garlic, and a fragrant blend of herbs and spices. Though simple, Lobio holds a deep place in Georgian cuisine, often served in clay pots with cornbread (mchadi) and pickled vegetables.</p>
    <p>Its roots trace back centuries, especially in the Kakheti and Imereti regions, where beans were a staple of everyday life. Traditionally prepared in rural homes over wood fires, Lobio reflects Georgia’s rich agricultural heritage and the beauty of making something deeply flavorful from humble ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Traditional Lobio Recipe (Serves 4–6)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (about 400 g) dried red kidney beans (or 3 cans, drained and rinsed)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp blue fenugreek (optional, but authentic)</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground chili or crushed red pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp red wine vinegar or lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Beans: If using dried beans, soak overnight. Drain and simmer with a bay leaf until soft (about 1.5–2 hours). If using canned, skip this step.</li>
        <li>Make the Base: In a pan, heat oil and sauté onions until golden. Add garlic, coriander, blue fenugreek, and chili. Cook until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Combine & Simmer: Add the beans (and some of their cooking water) to the onion mixture. Mash some of the beans to thicken. Season with salt and simmer for 10–15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Finish: Stir in vinegar or lemon juice and chopped cilantro. Adjust seasoning.</li>
        <li>Serve Warm or Cold: Lobio is delicious hot or at room temperature, often with mchadi (Georgian cornbread) or puri (traditional bread), and pickled vegetables.</li>
